```

## Sample Data

The database comes with sample data:
- **Users**: Alice (rep), Bob Manager (manager), Carol Admin (admin)
- **Leads**: Bob Buyer, Sarah Customer, Mike Prospect
- **Opportunities**: Various deals in different stages

## Environment Variables

- `PORT`: Server port (default: 3001)
- `JWT_SECRET`: Secret key for JWT tokens (default: 'your-secret-key')

## Development

The backend uses:
- **Express.js** for the web framework
- **CORS** for cross-origin requests
- **JWT** for authentication
- **express-validator** for input validation
- **UUID** for generating unique IDs
- **bcryptjs** for password hashing (ready for production use)

## Notes

- Passwords are stored in plain text for demo purposes. In production, use bcrypt for hashing.
- The database is stored in JSON format in `../public/db.json`
- All timestamps are handled by the application logic
- Error handling includes proper HTTP status codes and error messages
